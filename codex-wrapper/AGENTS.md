## SCX platform API docs (authoritative)
- **https://platform.scx.ai/docs** — the full SCX API reference. When building/using
  any SCX call (chat/completions, responses, models, embeddings, audio, moderation),
  consult this. SCX is reached with **SCX_API_KEY only** (Bearer) at
  `https://api.scx.ai/v1` — NEVER OPENAI_/ANTHROPIC_ creds. Agentic path = kcodex
  (`kritical-codex.ps1` -> `scx-agentic-shim.mjs` :4199, provider=scx).
- **https://platform.scx.ai/docs/guides/batches** — SCX Batch API. Use for BULK/async
  offload (cheaper, higher throughput than per-request) — mass mining, codegen,
  doc-extraction over many files. Prefer batches for large fan-outs on SCX.

# 🔴 SWARM TRACKING + RULE ZERO (propagated — one authority, do not hand-edit)

## 🔴 The three commands — run them from disk, never from memory

```
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Get-KritSwarmLedger.mjs"
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Get-KritAgentForensics.mjs" --unreturned
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Export-KritSwarmJournalFindings.mjs" --out <dir>
```

🔴 **RUN `Get-KritAgentForensics.mjs --unreturned` FIRST AFTER ANY RESTART, CRASH OR SESSION
LIMIT — BEFORE RE-RUNNING ANY LANE.** The ledger says whether an agent returned; **forensics
says what a dead agent actually WROTE.**

**WHY — a missing result is NOT a missing outcome.** A `StructuredOutput` failure and a
session-limit kill both emit **no result line whatsoever**, so in the journal a lost report is
**indistinguishable from an agent still thinking**. The agent almost certainly DID the work.
Measured 2026-08-01: **1,670 agents, 173 never returned, and 36 of those HAD WRITTEN REAL
FILES** — test suites and deploy scripts sitting on disk while every status surface reported
them incomplete. Re-running a lane on the assumption *it never finished so nothing happened*
is how work gets duplicated or silently clobbered. Check `git status` and the agent's
`agent-<id>.jsonl` transcript before re-running anything.

## RULE ZERO — one line

**RULE ZERO in one line: READ THE INDEX AND THE DOCS BEFORE YOU CLAIM A THING DOES NOT EXIST.** You do not get to say a thing does not exist — only that you looked, where, and what you found. 4 false absence-claims in one session: *"No PowerShell semantic Lens ingester exists anywhere in th...* · *`UNDECLARED` read as "not built".* · *"`.github/workflows/` DOES NOT EXIST."* · *`Kritical.Lens.QAArsenal`.*.

## Verbatim source — RULE ZERO-B

*(copied byte-for-byte from the authority above so this copy cannot drift from it)*

# 🔴 RULE ZERO-B — NEVER SPAWN AN AGENT THAT IS NOT PROGRAMMATICALLY TRACKED (HARD RULE)

**Operator directive 2026-08-01, after ~176 agents across ~7 concurrent swarms died with nobody
able to say what they had done, written, or left half-finished.**

**Before dispatching ANY agent or swarm, and at the END of every turn that ran one, run the
ledger — never your memory:**

```
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Get-KritSwarmLedger.mjs"
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Get-KritAgentForensics.mjs" --unreturned
node "C:\Users\joshl\OneDrive - Kritical Pty Ltd\Github\Kritical.Lens\scripts\Export-KritSwarmJournalFindings.mjs" --out <dir>
```

🔴 **RUN `Get-KritAgentForensics.mjs --unreturned` FIRST AFTER ANY RESTART, CRASH OR SESSION
LIMIT — BEFORE RE-RUNNING ANY LANE.** It is the only thing that tells you **what a dead agent
actually WROTE**. The ledger says whether an agent returned; forensics says what it left on disk.
Measured 2026-08-01: **1,670 agents, 173 never returned, and 36 of those had written real files** —
including test suites and deploy scripts sitting on disk while every status surface reported them
incomplete. Re-running a lane on the assumption "it never finished so nothing happened" is how work
gets duplicated or silently clobbered.

Memory is not tracking. A remembered swarm count was measured **wrong by 4×** (believed ~15
running; actually 4 of 57, with 153 agents started and never returned).

**For every agent you must be able to answer, from disk and not from recall:** is it still
running · what was it asked to do · which files did it WRITE · which did it NOT · did it commit ·
did it return a result at all.

**🔴 A MISSING RESULT IS NOT A MISSING OUTCOME.** A `StructuredOutput` failure and a session-limit
kill both emit **no result line whatsoever** — verified on `wf_731e7b0d-ecc` (harness reported
`agents_empty_result=1`; journal held 15 `started`, 14 `result`). So in the journal a lost report
is indistinguishable from an agent still thinking. **The agent almost certainly DID the work.**
Check `git status` and its `agent-<id>.jsonl` transcript before re-running anything.

**Gate agents run LAST, so a session limit strips the VERIFICATION layer off every workflow while
the production layer completes.** Measured repeatedly: builds 3/3 ✓ then gates 0/6 ✗; runs 6/7 ✓
then gates 0/14 ✗ at **zero tokens**. The estate therefore accumulates **finished-but-unverified**
work, which is worse than unfinished work because it looks done.

**"Built" does not mean "safe".** Persist and push before the next step: tonight a whole component
had no git, ten docs were untracked, a 623-insertion commit was stranded on a detached HEAD, and
1,492 agent results lived only inside journal files.
